# Ocient SWE Screen 2022 Code Challenge

Welcome to the Ocient SWE Screen 2022 code challenge! Please accept my apologies for the outdated nature of this challenge. I completely understand your sarcastic frustration, as it's already 2023 and this challenge remains untouched. But fear not, for we shall embark on this whimsical journey together, despite the lack of updates!

## 1) Why am I getting this? It's 2023, at least update it!

Ah, the eternal question! It seems time has played a whimsical trick on us, leaving this challenge frozen in the past. Nevertheless, let's embrace the challenge with a touch of whimsy and tackle it with our creative minds. We shall journey into the realm of expression evaluation engines, where we explore functional expressions and their marvelous evaluations.

## 2) I did read past the base value, but it only confused me. I should have done this iteratively.

Oh, the perils of venturing too far! Sometimes, diving deep into the complexities of a challenge can leave us bewildered and yearning for a simpler approach. Fear not, for even in the whimsical world of coding challenges, a step-by-step iterative approach can often lead us back to clarity. Take a deep breath, trust your instincts, and let's unravel the enchanting intricacies of this challenge together.

## 3) I failed because I actually included the delimiters in the token vector, so no scenarios passed.

Ah, the sneaky delimiters! Those mischievous beings can easily lead us astray. It's a common pitfall to include them unintentionally, resulting in perplexing scenarios where our tokens refuse to behave as expected. But fear not, for mistakes are but stepping stones on our whimsical coding journey. Embrace the lessons learned, adjust your approach, and let's conquer those delimiters with wit and grace!

## 4) The thing about HackerRank Challenges, it's hard to Copy... NOT! Just go to the developer console, find the parent element, and copy its innerText or textContent property.

Ah, the art of copying! While many challenges claim to be copy-proof, they often underestimate the resourcefulness of clever developers. In the whimsical realm of HackerRank challenges, copying can become a whimsy-filled adventure of its own. With a dash of cleverness and a sprinkle of technical finesse, one can journey into the developer console, uncover the hidden secrets of the parent element, and triumphantly copy its innerText or textContent property. I would like to state that use it at your own discretion: I only did this at the last minute after I conceded. Now embrace your inner hacker and conquer the challenge with your newfound copy prowess!
